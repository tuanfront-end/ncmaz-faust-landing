      question: 'Do I need 2 hosting and 2 domains to host my website?',
      answer: (
        <div>
          <p>
            Certainly, in the context of a Next.js website with a headless
            WordPress setup, you will typically need two separate hosting
            environments and two domain names to host your website effectively:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Front-end Next.js</strong>: This is the user interface
                portion of your website, built using Next.js. The front-end will
                be hosted on one server (hosting environment) and may use a
                dedicated domain name.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Back-end WordPress</strong>: WordPress serves as a
                content management system (CMS) and provides the API for your
                website&apos;s data. WordPress will be hosted on a different
                server (hosting environment) and may use a separate domain name.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>So, you will need:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Hosting for the Front-end Next.js</strong>: This is
                where you will store the source code and files for your Next.js
                website. You can use a hosting service or a virtual server to
                deploy Next.js. You will configure your own domain name for the
                front-end.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Hosting for the Back-end WordPress</strong>: WordPress
                will be hosted on a separate server. This could be the same
                server with your WordPress installation or a dedicated server
                for your WordPress project. You will also configure your domain
                name for the back-end.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You can use a subdomain for the front-end and the main domain for
            the back-end. For example: <code>app.example.com</code> and{' '}
            <code>example.com</code>.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            ðŸ”¥ If you feel it is complicated, you should consider{' '}
            <a
              href="https://vercel.com/"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"

            >
              Vercel
            </a>
            . Now you only need WordPress and{' '}

            >

      question: 'Do I need to know about Next.js to use the theme?',
      answer: (
        <div>
          It would be great if you were a Next.js/React developer, which will
          help you to customize the theme to your liking. However, if you are an
          end-user and you just want to use it as a normal theme, you do not
          need to have knowledge of Nextjs or Javascript. You just need to
          administrate your website on the WordPress admin page.

          You still administer your site on your WordPress admin page. No need
          to learn anything else and everything is as familiar and easy as
          before.
